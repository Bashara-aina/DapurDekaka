Please stop making general fixes and instead verify each layer step by step. At each step, show the actual data or logs. Only proceed to the next step after confirming the previous one is correct.

Front-End Form

Show the exact JSX/HTML for the <form> and <input> elements (including encType, name attributes, etc.).
Show the fetch or Axios call (including URL, method, headers, and credentials).
Log all form fields (e.g., formData.getAll('imageFile'), formData.get('name'), etc.) before sending.
Network Request

Open DevTools → Network tab. Screenshot or copy the request payload to confirm the field names.
Verify the response status code and response body from the server.
If it fails, note the exact error message or status code.
Server Route (menu.ts)

Before the creation logic, add console.log('req.body:', req.body); console.log('req.file:', req.file); console.log('req.files:', req.files);
Show the actual console output from the server when the request hits.
Confirm the field names match (name, description, imageFile).
If an error occurs here, show the exact error stack trace or message.
Multer / File Upload

Show the exact Multer config (e.g., upload.single('imageFile')).
Confirm the folder permissions on uploads/ (or whichever folder you’re using).
If Multer logs or triggers an error (like ‘Unexpected field’), identify which field name is mismatched.
Database Insertion

Show the code that inserts the new item into the database (e.g., INSERT INTO menu_items(...)).
Confirm that the image_url field is set from req.file.filename (or a path).
If a database error occurs, provide the exact error message (e.g., constraint violation, null error, etc.).
Iterate & Verify

After each step, confirm success or show the precise error message before moving on.
Do not jump ahead without verifying logs and payload data at the current layer.
Only after confirming all these steps do we finalize the fix. Provide the exact evidence (logs, payloads, code snippets) at each step to prove correctness.
