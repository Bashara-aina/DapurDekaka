So for the bloc creation. Create a comprehensive implementation plan for a Medium.com-style blog system with CRUD operations, customization features, and SEO optimization. Include detailed technical and UX specifications for the following components:

1. Core CRUD Functionality
A. Blog Creation (Create):

Design a WYSIWYG editor similar to Medium's interface:

Code block support with syntax highlighting

Seamless draft autosave (every 15 seconds)

Tagging system with suggested tags based on content

"Publish Now" vs "Schedule Post" options

B. Blog Reading (Read):

Implement a clean reading experience:

Clutter-free layout with optimal line length (50-75 characters)

Table of Contents auto-generation for long posts

Progress indicator for scroll position

Social sharing buttons with click tracking

Related posts algorithm (content-based filtering)

C. Editing (Update):

Version control system:

Track changes with diffs

30-day revision history

One-click rollback

Inline editing interface matching creation UI

Post-update notifications for subscribers

D. Deletion (Delete):

Soft delete system with:

7-day recovery period

Bulk delete management

Cascade deletion of associated comments/analytics

Permanent deletion protocol with confirmation modals

2. Medium-Style Customization

3. SEO Optimization Strategy
Implement technical SEO including:

Automatic schema markup generation for:

URL structure: /blog/{slug}-{6-digit-hash}

Dynamic meta tags:

Internal linking engine (3-5 related posts)

Technical SEO:

Pre-rendered AMP versions

Lazy-loaded images with decoding="async"

Sitemap.xml auto-generation/updating

4. Technical Implementation
Specify:

Recommended tech stack (e.g., React/Next.js frontend, Node.js/NestJS backend)

Database schema for posts/versions/tags

Caching strategy (Redis for API responses, CDN for assets)

Authentication flow for contributors (OAuth2 + Magic Links)

Analytics integration:

User engagement tracking (scroll depth, time spent)

Heatmap compatibility

Google Search Console API sync

5. UX Requirements
Performance targets:

<1s initial load (SSR/ISR)

<100ms API response times

Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms)

Accessibility:

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

Screen reader optimization

Keyboard navigation support

Provide architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams for critical flows (publishing/editing), and prioritized implementation roadmap with milestones. Include security considerations for user-generated content and GDPR compliance requirements.
