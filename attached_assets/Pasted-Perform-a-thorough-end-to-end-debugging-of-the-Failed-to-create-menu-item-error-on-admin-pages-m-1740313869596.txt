Perform a thorough, end-to-end debugging of the 'Failed to create menu item' error on /admin/pages/menu. Verify that the front-end form, back-end route, file upload, and database logic are correctly aligned. Specifically:

Front-End Form & Request

Confirm that the form fields (name, description, file upload) match exactly what the server expects (e.g., name="itemName", name="description", name="imageFile").
Ensure no extra or missing fields exist (we removed price/category).
Check that the form submission uses the correct HTTP method (POST) and endpoint.
File Upload Middleware

Verify the middleware configuration (e.g., Multer) is set up for a single file or multiple fields, matching the field name in the form.
Look for any file size or file type restrictions that might cause the request to fail.
Back-End Route & Validation

Inspect the create menu item route to confirm it no longer expects or validates price/category.
Confirm the request payload is parsed correctly, and that the server is handling the file upload path or file data properly.
Error Logs & Stack Traces

Check the server logs or console output for any specific error messages (e.g., validation failures, database errors, file system errors).
If possible, log the exact fields received in the route handler to confirm they match the form submission.
Database Interaction

Ensure the schema or table doesnâ€™t require price/category fields.
Confirm the new item insertion logic is correct and that the image (if stored) is handled properly.
Check for non-null constraints or triggers that could block item creation.
Testing & Iteration

After each fix, try creating a new menu item again.
If an error persists, capture and analyze the updated error messages, then address them.
Continue until the form submission works end-to-end, successfully creating a new menu item without price/category fields.
Please provide detailed reasoning, code snippets (if needed), and the exact error messages at each step. Continue until the form creates a new menu item without errors.
