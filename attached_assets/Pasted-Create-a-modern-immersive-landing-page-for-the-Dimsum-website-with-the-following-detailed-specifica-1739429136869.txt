Create a modern, immersive landing page for the Dimsum website with the following detailed specifications:

Landing Page (Pre-Homepage):

Background:
Use a continuous, full‑screen background composed of images sourced from the “asset” folder.
The background should always display three images at a time, arranged side by side to fully cover the viewport.
Implement a smooth, continuous horizontal scrolling effect: the images should scroll steadily to the left, and as an image completely leaves the left side of the screen, a new image should seamlessly enter from the right. This creates an infinite, looping carousel effect.
Overlay Content:
Display a prominent main tagline:
"Innovating Indonesia's Future with Cutting-Edge Technology"
Underneath, include a subtitle:
"Leading provider of power systems, digital transformation, and defense solutions."
Place a clear, call-to-action (CTA) button labeled:
"Masuk ke Perjalanan Kami"
Ensure the overlay content is centered and legible against the dynamic background.
User Interaction & Transition:

When the user clicks the CTA button, initiate a smooth transition effect (such as a fade-out or slide transition) that dismisses the landing page.
Upon completion of the transition, redirect the user to the main homepage. This can be implemented as a separate section or a different URL (e.g., index.html).
Design & Responsiveness:

Ensure that the background image carousel and overlay content are fully responsive, scaling appropriately on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Optimize performance so that images load quickly. Consider lazy loading techniques and provide a static fallback image or simplified animation if continuous scrolling is unsupported on some mobile devices.
Overall Aesthetic:

The design should evoke a modern, professional feel that aligns with the Dimsum brand.
The continuous, flowing movement of images should create a dynamic visual experience that draws users in and guides them toward exploring the site further.
Please implement these features without referencing any video elements—use only the images from the “asset” folder for the dynamic background effect.
