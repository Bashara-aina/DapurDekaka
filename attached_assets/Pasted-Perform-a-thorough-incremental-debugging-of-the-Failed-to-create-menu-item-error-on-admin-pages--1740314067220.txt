Perform a thorough, incremental debugging of the ‘Failed to create menu item’ error on /admin/pages/menu. Even after code fixes, the error persists. Please do the following steps in order, providing specific details, logs, and code snippets (if needed) at each step:

Front-End Form Review

Check the form field names (e.g., name, description, imageFile or similar).
Confirm the <input type="file" /> field’s name matches exactly what the server expects for file uploads.
Make sure there are no leftover references to price/category in the front-end code or request payload.
Verify the correct HTTP method (POST) and endpoint are being used.
Add Server-Side Debug Logs

In the server route handler that processes the menu creation, add console logs (e.g., console.log(req.body), console.log(req.file)) to see exactly what data is arriving from the front end.
Log any validation steps or error handling to pinpoint where the process fails.
Test with Postman or cURL

Temporarily bypass the front-end by sending a direct POST request to the server route.
Include the same fields (name, description, and file upload) to see if the request succeeds when not using the front-end form.
If it works with Postman/cURL, the issue is likely in the front-end code or how the form data is constructed.
If it still fails, the issue is likely in the server-side logic or database constraints.
Check File Upload Middleware

Ensure Multer (or whichever middleware you use) is configured to accept a file with the exact name attribute from the form or Postman. For example, if you use upload.single('imageFile'), confirm the <input name="imageFile"> on the front end and the Postman field name is also imageFile.
Look for file size, file type, or other constraints that might trigger an error.
Inspect Database / Schema Constraints

Confirm your table or collection no longer requires price or category fields.
Check for NOT NULL constraints or triggers that might block inserts if certain fields are missing.
Verify the logic that inserts the new menu item properly handles the uploaded image path or filename.
Review Error Logs & Stack Traces

Gather the exact error message or stack trace from the server console or logs when the creation fails.
If the error is generic (e.g., ‘Failed to create menu item’), try to surface the underlying error (database, validation, or file upload failure).
Iterate & Retest

After addressing each discovered issue, retest by creating a new menu item in two ways: via your front-end form and via Postman/cURL.
Continue adding or refining logs until the server’s console output clearly shows all data passing through successfully.
Final Verification

Once you can consistently create new menu items without errors, remove any temporary logs you no longer need.
Confirm the front end, server, and database all work together seamlessly with the updated fields.
Please detail your findings and the exact changes made at each step. Continue iterating until you can successfully create a new menu item (with name, description, and image upload) without price/category fields or any ‘Failed to create menu item’ errors.
